    commas are used as delimiter between adajacent fields on the same line
    If a field contains a comma, use double quotes.
    If a field contains double quote, the field needs to be wrapped in double
    quotes.

    Example::

        This is in "quotes", as well as commas

    is represented in the Sample Sheet as::

        "This is in ""quotes"", as well as commas"

    There is no minimum or maximum comma delimiters required on each line.

    The end of the line can be padded with as many commas as desired, which are ignored.

    Empty lines are ignored. Lines made of commas and/or white spaces only are ignored.

    Sections are case-sensitive and denoted by a line starting and ending with square
    brackets. Except for commas and end of line, no extra character after the
    ending square bracket are authorise.


    Sample sheet must begin with the [Header] section and end wuth the [Data]
    section. Others can be ordered arbitraly.

    **Header** section must be on the first line. It contains records represented
    as a series of key-value pairs. So, each line requires exactly two fields.

    **Settings** is an optional section with key-value pairs.

    **Reads** contains number of cycles per read. Only required for MiSeq.

    For adapters IEM sample sheet those fields are known to be present:
    [Version], [Name], [settings], [I7], [I5], [IndexPlateLayout].


    **Data** section: it is required and must be located at the end of the
    Sample Sheet file. The Data section is a CSV-like table.

    No specific ordering of the column names is required and they are
    not case-sensitive. At a minimum, the one column that is universally
    required is Sample_ID, which provides a unique string identifier
    for each sample.

    Example of typical Data section to be used with bcl2fastq::

        [Data]
        Sample_ID,Sample_Name,I7_Index_ID,index,I5_INdex_ID,index2
        A10001,Sample_A,D701,AATACTCG,D501,TATAGCCT
        A10002,Sample_B,D702,TCCGGAGA,D501,TATAGCCT
        A10003,Sample_C,D703,CGCTCATT,D501,TATAGCCT
        A10004,Sample_D,D704,GAGATTCC,D501,TATAGCCT
