class Coverage(object):
    r"""Utilities related to sequencing coverage

    We denote :math:`G` the genome length in nucleotides, :math:`L` the read
    length in nucleotides. These two numbers are in principle well defined since
    :math:`G` is defined by biology and :math:`L` by the sequencing machine.

    The total number of reads sequenced during an experiment is denoted
    :math:`N`. Therefore the total number of nucleotides is simply :math:`NL`.

    The coverage is then defined as :

    .. math:: a = NL/G

    that is the average number of times each nucleotide is sequenced (in the 
    whole genome). The coverage is often denoted :math:`aX` (e.g., 50X).

    In the :class:`Coverage` class, :math:`G` and :math:`N` are fixed at 
    the beginning. Then, if one changes :math:`a`, then :math:`N` is updated and
    vice-versa so that the relation :math:`a=NL/G` is up-to-date::

        >>> cover = Coverage(G=1000000, L=100)
        >>> cover.N = 100000    # number of reads
        >>> cover.a             # What is the mean coverage
        10
        >>> cover.a = 50
        >>> cover.N
        500000

    From the equation aforementionned, and assuming the reads are uniformly
    distributed, we can answer a few interesting questions using probabilities.

    In each chromosome, a read of length :math:`L` could start at any position
    (except the last position L-1). So in a genome :math:`G` with :math:`n_c`
    chromosomes, there are :math:`G - n_c (L-1)` possible starting positions.
    In general  :math:`G >> n_c (L-1)` so the probability that one of the
    :math:`N` read starts at any specific nucleotide is therefore :math:`N/G`.


    The probability that a read (of length :math:`L`) covers a given 
    position :math:`L/G`. The probability of **not** covering that location 
    is :math:`1-L/G`. For :math:`N` fragments, we obtain the probability
    :math:`\left(1-L/G\right)^N`. So, the probability of covering a given
    location with at least one read is :

    .. math:: P = 1 - \left(1- \frac{L}{G}\right)^N

    Since in general, N>>1, we have:

    .. math::  P = 1- \exp^{-NL/G}

    From this equation, we can derive the coverage required to have 
    e.g., :math:`E=99\%` of the genome covered:

    .. math:: a = log(-1/(E-1)

    equivalent to

    .. math:: a = -log(1-E)

    The method :meth:`get_required_coverage` uses this equation. However, for
    numerical reason, one should not provide :math:`E` as an argument but (1-E). 

    Other information can also be derived using the methods
    :meth:`get_mean_number_contigs`, :meth:`get_mean_contig_length`,
    :meth:`get_mean_contig_length`.

    .. seealso:: :meth:`get_table` that provides a summary of all these
        quantities for a range of coverage.

        A general question is what should be the coverage to make sure
        that e.g. E=99% of the genome is covered by at least a read.

        The answer is:

        .. math:: \log^{-1/(E-1)}

        This equation is correct but have a limitation due to floating precision. 
        If one provides E=0.99, the answer is 4.6 but we are limited to a
        maximum coverage of about 36 when one provides E=0.9999999999999999
        after which E is rounded to 1 but most computers. Besides, it is no
        convenient to enter all those numbers. A scientific notation would be better but
        requires to work with :math:`M=1-E` instead of :math:`E`.

        .. math:: \log^{-1/ - M}

        So instead of asking the question what is
        requested coverage to have 99% of the genome covered, we ask the question what
        is the requested coverage to have 1% of the genome not covered.
        This allows us to use :math:`M` valuesas low as 1e-300 that is coverage 
        as high as 690
