    """
    SARTools is a R package dedicated to the differential analysis of RNA-seq data.
    It provides tools to generate descriptive and diagnostic graphs, to run the differential analysis
    with one of the well known DESeq2 or edgeR packages and to export the results into easily readable
    tab-delimited files. It also facilitates the generation of a HTML report which displays all the
    figures produced, explains the statistical methods and gives the results of the differential analysis.

    Required input:
        __SARTools__input: a list of count files

    Required output:
        __SARTools__output_directory: a directory with all count files
        __SARTools__target_file: a target file with the design and the corresponding count files
