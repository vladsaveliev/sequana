Pipelines
##############

In **Sequana** parlance, a pipeline is an application based on Snakemake that consists of a Snakefile and a configuration file.

For snakemake tutorial, you can have a look at the Snakemake page or
online-tutorials (e.g. http://slowkow.com/notes/snakemake-tutorial/)

Pipelines can be initialised and run via a command line interface called
:ref:`sequana_app` but we would recommend to use :ref:`sequanix` instead.

The following sections are dedicated to each pipeline.
