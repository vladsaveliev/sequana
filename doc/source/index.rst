What is Sequana ?
=====================

Sequana provides (i) modules and pipelines dedicated to NGS in the form of Snakefiles (Makefile-like syntax with Python syntax) and (ii) tools to help in the creation of such pipelines and associtated HTML reports.


Installation
#################


:: 

    pip install sequana

Examples
##########

Given a set of FASTQ files in a local directory, you can run a pipeline as
follows (given its name)::

Pipelines can be found in the directory ./pipelines
