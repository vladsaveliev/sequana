0.6.5
~~~~~~~~~~~

* CHANGES:

    * sequana_coverage. Major refactoring of bedtools module to handle large
      data sets (human), and provide ability to focus on CNVs using an
      additional naive clustering (merge_rois_into_cnvs method) and binning. 
      We can also analyse data chunk by chunk (to avoid filling the memory). 
      added a plot_rois function
    * sequana_coverage standalone: add the --chunksize, --cnv-clustering and
      --binning options.

* NEWS:

    * add cnvnator class
    * coverage pipeline added in the pipelines

* BUGS:

    * Fix silent warning (regex) in snpeff module
    * double indexing adapters issue for Nextera fixed: https://github.com/sequana/sequana/issues/501


0.6.4
~~~~~~~~~~

* BUGS:

    * Fix issue https://github.com/sequana/sequana/issues/380 is_sorted property
      of the BAM class.
    * Fix --no-report option in sequana_coverage and add --clustering (double
      threshold option)
    * pacbio_qc pipeline is now able to also read old pacbio format

* NEWS:

    * SARTools rule added and used in the RNAseq pipeline
    * add summary module to store summary in json formats.
    * simple vcf_filter standalone

* CHANGES:

    * pin kraken version to 1.1 (newest on bioconda)
    * MAJOR REFACTORING of bedtools and sequana_coverage standalone. In
      particular, change default window size to 20,001 or a fifth of genome 
      length (for small genome); speed up code; add plot_roi function, uses
      multiqc for summary page; add log2 ratio column. See
      https://github.com/sequana/sequana/issues/495 for details. 
      Scan large files by chunk. Add a snakemake that can be used in sequanix.
    * remove the sequana_report standalone, which was not finalised and won't be
      used in the future. We will use multiqc instead.

0.6.3.post1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- a bug fix in the sequanix GUI and singularity. a statement related to the 
  ruamel.yaml package causes trouble if version is not 0.15. A temporary fix
  consisted in adding a try/except (the statement is just a warning.filter and
  has no impact on analysis)

0.6.3
~~~~~~~~~~~

* BUGS:

    * Fix bug in the copy of the fastqc data sets in the quality control
    * atropos bug in the reports (not full). Bug reported to atropos
      github. https://github.com/jdidion/atropos/issues/57. Need to use version
      1.1.16
    * kraken report table were not sorted by percentage (as expected). Also,
      if the case of poor databases with few entries, the output may contain
      lots of classified sequences with Taxon 1, which was not reported
      correctly in the krona plot.

* NEWS:

    * example of a schema.yaml implemented for the quality control.
    * sequanix: reads schema.yaml automatically for sequana pipelines
      and can import one for generic cases. An option in the preference
      was added to switch on/off the validation of the config file with this
      schema. Can also import schema file for the generic case.

* CHANGES:

    * Taxonomy file is downloaded for Kraken only when Kraken is used, not in
      the main __init__  file anymore.

     pipeline computed in FastQC class (see 
     https://github.com/sequana/sequana/issues/470)

         fail on clusters. Does not change the pipeline or analysis itself

   * Fix genbank_parser when the genbank contains several concatenated genbank
     entries. This fixes the coverage reports CSV file that had missing
     annotations.

      Now, available for all.
    - Fix the main script for the reference in variant calling pipeline.


* CHANGES:

    - sequana_compressor: for conversion from e.g gz to bz2, use a pipe instead
